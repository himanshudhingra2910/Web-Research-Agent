Research Summary:
The terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, on April 23, 2025, left 26 people dead, including 25 Indian citizens and one Nepali national. The gunmen targeted tourists in a popular travel destination accessible only by foot or horseback. A little-known militant group, The Resistance Front (TRF), claimed responsibility for the attack, citing opposition to "outsiders" settling in the region. Indian authorities suspect Pakistani nationals were involved, reigniting tensions between India and Pakistan over the disputed region.

India has implemented several punitive measures, including the suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, downgrading diplomatic ties, restricting cross-border travel, and heightening military presence in the region. In response, Pakistan closed its airspace, halted trade, and expelled Indian diplomats, warning that diversion of Indus waters would be considered an "act of war."

The attack marks one of the deadliest on civilians in recent years in Kashmir, a region marred by decades of violence and territorial disputes between the two nuclear-armed nations. The incident has escalated fears of military conflict, with India vowing to pursue the attackers and Pakistan denying involvement while urging evidence from Delhi. The international community has condemned the violence, with world leaders expressing condolences.
