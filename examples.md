Query: "What is going in Kasmir India?"

Research Summary:
The situation in Kashmir, India, has reached a critical level following a deadly attack in the Pahalgam region of Indian-administered Kashmir, where gunmen killed 26 civilians, primarily tourists, in the deadliest civilian attack in the region since 2000. India has blamed Pakistan for the attack, claiming involvement by Pakistan-based militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), though Pakistan has denied the allegations. A militant group called Kashmir Resistance claimed responsibility for the attack, which reportedly included targeting non-Muslims based on identity.

In response, India has taken a series of strong retaliatory measures, including:

1. **Suspending the Indus Waters Treaty**, a decades-old agreement overseeing water-sharing between the two nations, which Pakistan has called an "act of war."
2. **Downgrading diplomatic ties**, expelling Pakistan's military diplomats from India and recalling its own from Pakistan.
3. **Blocking a key border crossing** between the two countries, halting all trade and restricting the movement of people.
4. **Canceling a visa exemption scheme** for Pakistani nationals and mandating those in India under this scheme to leave within 48 hours.

Pakistan has retaliated by closing its airspace to Indian aircraft, fully suspending trade, and reducing the number of Indian diplomats in Pakistan.

The attack has prompted widespread mourning and protests in India, with vigils held in Kashmir and across the country. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has vowed to pursue and punish those responsible, calling the attack a strike at the nation's heart. Indian security forces are conducting a massive search operation to apprehend the suspects, with wanted posters released for three militants identified, including two Pakistani nationals.

The incident has further strained the already volatile relationship between the nuclear-armed neighbors, who both claim the Himalayan territory of Kashmir in its entirety. Observers fear this escalation may worsen tensions, with concerns over diplomatic fallout, future water disputes, and the risk of military confrontation.

Domestically, the attack has exacerbated anti-Pakistan rhetoric in India, led to calls for solidarity, and heightened fears of reprisals against Kashmiris living in other parts of India. Internationally, the events have cast a shadow over high-profile diplomatic visits, such as that of U.S. Vice President JD Vance, and drawn attention to the enduring risks of instability in the region. Both nations face growing calls to address their differences through dialogue rather than conflict.
